# BMI Calculator (C)

This is a simple command-line calculator, written in C, for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI).

The program prompts the user for their weight in kilograms (kg) and height in meters (m) and calculates their BMI using the standard metric formula.

## How to Use

### 1. Compile the Code

You will need a C compiler (like `gcc`) installed on your system.

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing main.c
cd BMICalculator-C

# Compile the program
gcc main.c -o bmi_calculator
```
### 2. Run the Program
Once compiled, you can run the executable:
```
./bmi_calculator
Example Usage
Enter your weight in kilograms (e.g., 68.5): 70
Enter your height in meters (e.g., 1.75): 1.75
