# Project 
A straightforward and robust console application built in C++ to perform fundamental arithmetic calculations. Designed for command-line execution, this project demonstrates basic C++ syntax, input/output handling, and structured control flow using a switch statement.

## Implementations
- Consists of Basic Maths operators:
- Addition(+)
- Subtraction(-)
- Division( / )
- Multiplication (*)

## Usage
- Performing Addition, Subtraction , Multiplication , Division between two Numbers

## Format
Format must be:
- Selecting the desired operator among (+ - * /)
- Input for Number1 and Number2

## Requirements
- Any C++ compiler works

## Error-Handling
-  Includes specific checks for critical errors, such as division by zero.
-  Avoiding non integer inputs

### Compile the Code
Navigate to the directory containing `main.cpp` and use the C++ compiler (`g++`) to build the executable:
```
g++ main.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
```
