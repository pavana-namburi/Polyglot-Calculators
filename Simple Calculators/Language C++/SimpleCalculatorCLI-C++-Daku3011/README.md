# Simple Calculator in C++

A basic command-line calculator implementation in C++ that performs fundamental arithmetic operations.

## Description

This calculator is a contribution to the [Awesome-Calculators](https://github.com/Awesome-Calculators) collection. 
It provides basic arithmetic operations including:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

## Features

- It's not sensitive for floats, only calculates and concludes with integers
- Simple and clean command-line interface
- Input validation for division by zero
- Error handling for invalid operators
- Integer-based calculations

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o calculator
```

2. Run the executable:
```
./calculator
```

3. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter two integers when asked
   - Choose an operator (+, -, *, /)
   - View the result

## Example Usage

```
Enter two integers: 10 5
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): +
Addition of 10 and 5 is : 15
```
