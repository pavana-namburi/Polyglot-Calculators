# Simple Console Calculator in C

A basic, robust command-line calculator written in C, designed to perform the four fundamental arithmetic operations. This project was created as a contribution to the Awesome-Calculators repository to fulfill Issue #68.

## ✨ Features

* **Four Basic Operations:** Supports Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), and Division (`/`).
* **Zero-Division Checking:** Includes validation to prevent division by zero errors.
* **Robust Input Handling:** Functions for input handling ensure that the program correctly processes only numeric values and valid operators.
* **Clean Code:** Modularized functions to separate input/output logic from arithmetic logic.

## ⚙️ How to Run

### Prerequisites

You need a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC or Clang).

### 1. Compile the Code

Navigate to the directory containing `main.c` and use a C compiler to build the executable:

```bash
gcc main.c -o simple_calc
````

### 2\. Execute the Program

Run the compiled executable from your terminal:

```bash
./simple_calc
```

## 🚀 Example Usage

The program will first prompt the user to enter two numbers and then continuously ask for the operation to perform.

```
Enter a value : 45.5

Enter a value : 5.0

Select the operation to perform(+,-,/,*) : /
45.50 / 5.00 = 9.10
```
