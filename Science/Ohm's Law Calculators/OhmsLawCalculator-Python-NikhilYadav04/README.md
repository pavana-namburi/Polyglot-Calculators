# ⚡ Ohm’s Law Calculator (Python)

A lightweight command-line tool that calculates **Voltage (V)**, **Current (I)**, or **Resistance (R)** using **Ohm’s Law**.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Compute:
  - `V = I × R`
  - `I = V ÷ R`
  - `R = V ÷ I`
- Accepts both uppercase & lowercase options (`V`, `I`, `R`)
- Clean, modular structure using Python functions
- Handles division by zero and invalid inputs gracefully

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd OhmLawCalculator-Python-NikhilYadav04

# Run the program
python main.py
Enter your choice (V/I/R): i
Enter Voltage (V): 12
Enter Resistance (R): 4
As per formula I = V / R = 3.00 A

Python 3.6+ required
Works in any terminal (no external libraries)

Input validation for non-numeric values is included.
Script can be easily extended or integrated into larger projects.
