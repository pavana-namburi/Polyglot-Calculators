# 📐 Simple Area Calculator (Python)

A simple *command-line tool* to calculate the area of basic geometric shapes, written in Python.  

This calculator was created to address [Issue #23](https://github.com/B3rou/Awesome-Calculators/issues/23) in the **Awesome-Calculators** repository.  

---

## 📦 Features

- Calculates area for:
  - **Circle** (using $\pi r^2$)
  - **Rectangle** (using $length \times width$)
  - **Square** (using $side^2$)
  - **Triangle** (using $0.5 \times base \times height$)
- Interactive, user-friendly menu interface.
- Input validation for numeric values (handles errors and negative numbers).

## 🚀 How to Run

No external dependencies required (only Python’s built-in `math` library).  
Simply run with Python 3:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 💡 Example Usage

```bash
--- 📐 Simple Area Calculator ---
Calculates the area of basic geometric shapes.
Type 'exit' at any time to quit.

Please select a shape:
  1. Circle
  2. Rectangle
  3. Square
  4. Triangle (Base/Height)
  5. Exit

Enter choice (1-5): 1
Enter the radius of the circle: 10

--- Result ---
The area of a circle with radius 10 is: 314.1593
